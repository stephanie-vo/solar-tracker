# ‚òÄÔ∏è Automated Solar Tracker

This project is a dual-axis solar tracking system designed to optimize solar panel alignment with the sun. The system uses **photoresistors (LDRs)** to detect the direction of maximum light intensity and **servo motors** to adjust the panel‚Äôs orientation accordingly. A **GY-521 accelerometer-gyroscope module** monitors the tilt angle in real time for added feedback.
